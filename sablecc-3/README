README

This is a compiler in Java for the JOOS language.

REQUIREMENTS

- SableCC installation
- Jasmin installation (included in this installation)
- a Unix-compatible environment: to be able to run Bin's sh and csh scripts
- an installation of Java, version 1.2 or later 

SETTING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

This step is required in order to be able to do anything with the compiler.
The following environment variables must be set:
- JJOOSDIR: root directory of the JJOOS compiler installation
- JOOSDIR:  root directory of ordinary JOOS installation
- JAVADIR: root directory of the JDK installation
- SABLECCDIR: root directory of the SableCC installation

COMPILING THE COMPILER

1. if grammar has changed, compile it first: Bin/compilegrammar.csh
2. compile the compiler: Bin/compile.sh

RUNNING THE COMPILER

- compilation into Jasmin files: 
Bin/jjoos $JOOSDIR/Extern/*.joos <file.java>... <file.joos>...

- compilation into Java class files:
Bin/jjoosc <file.java>... <file.joos>...

To run JOOS programs that make use of the JOOS library, 
add the Lib directory to your classpath.

Enjoy!

UPGRADE OF THE JJOOS COMPILER

The JJOOS was upgraded to use the SableCC3.0 compiler generator during the summer of 
2003. The main change was in the JJOOS grammar which now has a set of rules which 
generate an Abstract Syntax Tree instead of a Concrete Syntax Tree which was the case 
with the previous version of SableCC. There were changes to other files as well and 
that has been reflected in the history at the top of each file. We now require only 
a single pass of the fixer. 

SableCC was updated to SableCC3.0 by Kevin Agbakpem at the University of Quebec at 
Montreal. 

Enjoy!
